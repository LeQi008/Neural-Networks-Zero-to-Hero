# Neural Networks: Zero to Hero

This repository is a personal study log following Andrej Karpathy's ["Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) YouTube series.

## About
The code here primarily consists of implementations and exercises from Karpathyâ€™s GitHub, with my own added comments and annotations to aid my understanding. This is more of a learning log than a polished project, so the focus is on personal comprehension rather than perfection.
