    "Embedding characters and their positions as multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) might initially seem like it could obscure their individual characteristics, but this technique is foundational to the success of neural networks in natural language processing (NLP) and other tasks. Let's break down why this works and how it retains the necessary information:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding Process: A Quick Recap\n",
    "1. Token Embedding:\n",
    "Each character (or token) is mapped to a high-dimensional vector.\n",
    "These vectors are learned during training, capturing semantic properties of characters or words.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Positional Embedding:\n",
    "Each position in a sequence is also mapped to a high-dimensional vector.\n",
    "These vectors encode positional information, ensuring the model can differentiate between the same token in different positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Information is Retained\n",
    "1. Semantic Information from Token Embeddings\n",
    "- Learning Representations: During training, the model learns to adjust the embeddings such that characters with similar roles in context have similar vectors. For example, 'a' and 'e' might have embeddings that are closer in vector space than 'a' and 'z'.\n",
    "- Dimensionality: High-dimensional vectors can capture a wide range of characteristics. Each dimension of the vector can represent a different aspect of the character's role in language (e.g., phonetic features, position in words, syntactic roles).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Positional Information from Positional Embeddings\n",
    "- Relative Positioning: Positional embeddings ensure that the model knows the position of each token within a sequence. This allows the model to understand context in a way that respects the order of tokens.\n",
    "- Distinct Embeddings: Each position gets a unique vector, which when added to the token embeddings, creates a combined vector that is unique to both the character and its position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Combination of Token and Positional Embeddings\n",
    "- Element-wise Addition: By adding positional embeddings to token embeddings, the resulting vectors carry both the semantic meaning of the token and its positional context.\n",
    "- Learning Patterns: The neural network learns to interpret these combined vectors. For example, 'e' at the beginning of a word might be interpreted differently from 'e' at the end of a word because the positional embeddings modify the token embeddings in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Retains Characteristics\n",
    "- High-Dimensional Space: The high dimensionality allows for rich representations where different dimensions can capture different aspects of the token and its context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contextual Relationships: The model learns contextual relationships. For example, 'h' followed by 'e' followed by 'l' might learn to represent the sequence 'hel' differently than 'elh' even though the token embeddings for 'h', 'e', and 'l' are the same in both sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Differentiability: Neural networks, especially deep ones, are powerful function approximators. The embeddings allow the network to differentiate and learn complex patterns and relationships in the data."

    "- In an \"encoder\" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with tril, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a \"decoder\" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.\n",
    "- \"self-attention\" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n",
